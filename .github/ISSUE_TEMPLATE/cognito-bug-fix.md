  - [ ] Document current workarounds (if any)
  - [ ] Identify users who might be affected
- [ ] **Test Provider Fix**
  - [ ] Update to fixed provider version
  - [ ] Verify fix resolves the issue
  - [ ] Check for any breaking changes in behavior
- [ ] **Module Compatibility**
  - [ ] Ensure module works with both old and new provider versions
  - [ ] Update minimum provider version requirements if needed
  - [ ] Validate all examples still work correctly

#### Code Changes Required
- [ ] **Configuration Updates**

  ```

### Action Plan

#### Phase 1: Investigation
- [ ] **Reproduce Original Bug**
  - [ ] Create test case demonstrating the bug
  - [ ] Document exact conditions that trigger the issue
  - [ ] Verify impact on module functionality
- [ ] **Test Provider Fix**
  - [ ] Update test environment to fixed provider version

  - [ ] Run full test suite with new provider version
  - [ ] Validate backward compatibility (if maintaining support for older versions)
  - [ ] Test edge cases that might be affected
- [ ] **Example Updates**
  - [ ] Update examples to use fixed behavior
  - [ ] Remove workaround code from examples
  - [ ] Add test case that would have failed before fix

#### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Document the fix in README
  - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with bug fix details
