# Bug Fix Summary: AWS Cognito Managed Login Branding Client ID Resolution

## Issue Description
The `awscc_cognito_managed_login_branding` resource's `client_id` resolution logic had two critical flaws:

1. **Incorrect Regex Pattern**: The regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9+]{26}$` incorrectly included the `+` character for detecting literal AWS Cognito client IDs. AWS Cognito client IDs are 26-character alphanumeric strings (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 only), without plus signs.

2. **Unsafe Fallback Logic**: When a client name lookup failed, the original code passed the invalid input directly as a client ID using `lookup(local.client_name_to_id_map, each.value.client_id, each.value.client_id)`, which would cause AWS API errors.

## Root Cause
- Client names that were exactly 26 characters long and alphanumeric were misidentified as literal client IDs due to the incorrect regex pattern
- Failed client name lookups resulted in passing invalid inputs to the AWS API instead of failing fast

## Solution Implemented

### File: `managed-login-branding.tf` (lines 7-11)

**Before:**
```terraform
# AWS Cognito client IDs are 26-character alphanumeric strings (pattern: [\w+]+)
# If the input is exactly 26 characters and alphanumeric, treat it as a literal client ID
# Otherwise, look it up in the client name map
client_id = can(regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9+]{26}$", each.value.client_id)) ? each.value.client_id : lookup(local.client_name_to_id_map, each.value.client_id, each.value.client_id)
```

**After:**
```terraform
# AWS Cognito client IDs are 26-character alphanumeric strings (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 only)
# If the input is exactly 26 characters and alphanumeric, treat it as a literal client ID
# Otherwise, look it up in the client name map (will fail if not found)
client_id = can(regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{26}$", each.value.client_id)) ? each.value.client_id : local.client_name_to_id_map[each.value.client_id]
```

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Regex Pattern**: 
   - Changed from `^[a-zA-Z0-9+]{26}$` to `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{26}$`
   - Removed the incorrect `+` character from the pattern
   - Updated comment to clarify the correct format

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Replaced `lookup(local.client_name_to_id_map, each.value.client_id, each.value.client_id)` with `local.client_name_to_id_map[each.value.client_id]`
   - This ensures Terraform will fail fast with a clear error message when a client name is not found
   - Prevents invalid inputs from being passed to the AWS API

## Impact
- Client names that are 26 characters long and alphanumeric will now be correctly looked up in the client name map instead of being treated as literal client IDs
- Invalid client name references will now fail with a clear Terraform error instead of causing AWS API errors
- The configuration is more robust and provides better error reporting

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with 26-character alphanumeric client names to ensure they're properly resolved
- Test with invalid client names to verify proper error handling
- Verify that legitimate 26-character client IDs still work correctly
